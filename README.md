# Spotify Clone

This project is a clone of the popular music streaming service Spotify. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and aims to replicate the basic functionalities of the original Spotify website. The clone includes two sections for English and Hindi songs, and allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous song, and switch between the English and Hindi sections.

## Features

1. **Song Selection**: The clone provides two sections for English and Hindi songs, allowing users to choose songs from their preferred language category.

2. **Play/Pause**: Users can play or pause the currently selected song by clicking on the play/pause button. This button toggles its state, visually indicating whether the song is currently playing or paused.

3. **Next/Previous Song**: Users can navigate to the next or previous song in the playlist using the dedicated next and previous buttons.

4. **Progress Bar**: The clone displays a progress bar for the currently playing song, showing the elapsed time and the remaining time. This feature allows users to track their progress within the song. User can navigate to any point in song by dragging the progress bar.
